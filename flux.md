# Flux

Flux is Facebook's data modeling, or data flow pattern, that are designed to work with React. It preaches unidirectional data flow and are the foundation of this reactive style of data management.   
  
We promised to go into Redux and to be honest Redux does not even implement all the features of Flux. But it does follow the unidirectional data flow pattern and it makes sense to have looked at Flux as a foundation.

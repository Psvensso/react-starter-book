# Flux

Flux a data modeling, or data flow pattern that came from Facebook a couple of years ago, its design to work well with React. It preaches unidirectional data flow and are the foundation of this reactive style of data management.

We promised to go into Redux and to be honest Redux does not even implement all the features of Flux. But it does follow the unidirectional data flow pattern and it makes sense to have looked at Flux as a foundation. Know your history!

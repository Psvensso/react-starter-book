# What is React

React is a [open-source javascript](https://github.com/facebook/react) library developed and maintained by Facebook.  
This quote is taken from the React documentation.

> React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.



But it's important to point out what the React library itself is not...

---

* ##### React is NOT a UI component library \(does not come with any pre-build components\)
* ##### React does NOT contain any service injection or other bootstrapping of files
* ##### React does NOT contain any router or DOM handlers
* ##### React does NOT have a template system

---

With React it's all about rendering state using components. Let's get to it.

# What is React

React is a UI library developed at Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive, stateful & reusable UI components. It is used at Facebook.com and Instagram.com is written entirely in React.

But it's important to point out what the React library itself is not...

---

* ##### React is NOT a UI component library \(does not come with any pre-build components\)
* ##### React does NOT contain any service injection or other bootstrapping of files
* ##### React does NOT contain any router or DOM handlers
* ##### React does NOT have a template system

---

With React it's all about rendering state using components. Let's get to it.
